       " 'after returning to india they started working in gadchiroli. they founded search in december 1985 and started working on community health problems in the tribal and rural areas of gadchiroli. search established a partnership with communities in gadchiroli for health and development and helped create \"tribal-friendly\" clinics and a hospital in the district.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' reduction in infant mortality rate \\'\\'\\'\\nwhen the couple started holding people health assemblies they found that addressing infant mortality was a pressing need. the death of a one-month-old child within minutes of being brought to them greatly impacted the couple. they found that there were 18 causes that may have been responsible for that infant\\'s death, ranging from poverty, diarrhoea, infection or pneumonia to lack of a hospital. the challenge was how to save an infant who can die of 18 causes. the bangs and their colleagues at search conducted world-class research on practical approaches to reduce mortality of young children in resource-constrained settings. bang\\'s solution was to train the village women in neonatal care. he wrote a draft of the action research to be conducted and sought comments from his mentor, carl e. taylor, the founder of the department of international health at johns hopkins university. in a handwritten note on the draft, taylor wrote \"abhay, this will be the most important work that you will ever do in your life\". subsequent work by abhay bang and his colleagues in two of the most notable of their studies demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of community-based management of childhood pneumonia and the provision of home-based neonatal care by community health workers.\\nhome based neonatal care (hbnc) model developed by bang has resulted in reduction in infant mortality in the study villages of gadchiroli. the home-based neonatal care interventions developed at search ignited worldwide interest and research on preventing neonatal deaths in high-mortality, resource-constrained settings. prior to that, such deaths were considered nearly impossible to avert. as a result of their work, home-based neonatal care and community-based management of childhood pneumonia are now being implemented throughout the world in these settings. although initially the medical fraternity objected to bang\\'s unconventional methods, they gradually understood his wisdom to provide an alternative to a large village community. later, indian paediatricians, after studying the evidence from the field, wholeheartedly backed bang\\'s initiative to save newborns. today, based on bang\\'s gadchiroli model, 800,000 village women in india are now being trained by the government under the asha programme. a report from the harvard university south asia institute states that \"search is world renowned for its pioneering work in home-based neonatal care\", \"the landmark paper, published in the lancet, changed the medical community\\'s perception of community health workers and the power of home based care for neonates forever\" and \"the success of the hbnc program spawned the creation of over 800,000 \"asha\" workers through india\\'s national rural health mission.\"\\nindia has incorporated this model in 12th national five-year plan to reduce infant mortality. this field trial showed that newborn care can be brought out of the confines of big hospitals and high tech units and be so simplified that it can be provided in any village in any home. after this research the global newborn care has never been the same. this approach, which brought down the infant mortality rate in rural gadchiroli from 121 per 1000 live births to 30, was honoured by the lancet in 2005 as one of the vintage papers. the editor and the historian of the journal considered bang\\'s paper on newborn care to be one of the milestone ones published in 180 years. this approach has been incorporated in the national program by the government of india and has been accepted by the who, unicef and usaid for reducing newborn mortality in developing countries.\\n\\nin may 2017, the high court of bombay invited abhay bang to provide suggestions about how to reduce child mortality and malnutrition in the state of maharashtra. the high court accepted the suggestions made by abhay bang and directed the state government to incorporate the recommendations in its policy decisions and take appropriate actions.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' liquor ban in gadchiroli district \\'\\'\\'\\nabhay and rani bang were driving force for the movement of liquor ban in gadchiroli district. gadchiroli is the first district in maharashtra where liquor is banned due to demand by the public. bang made people of gadchiroli aware about ill effects of alcohol, which led to demand from people to ban alcohol in gadchiroli. maharashtra government has come up with ban on alcohol in gadchiroli. in 1990, the couple raised a movement for liquor ban in gadchiroli district. the movement resulted in liquor ban in the district in year 1992, being the first example in india of liquor ban due to public demand. in may 2012, abhay bang was member of panel to study ban of liquor in chandrapur district. he advocates the need for an alcohol and tobacco free society since as per the global burden of diseases 2015, alcohol and tobacco are two of the top ten causes of death and disease in india. abhay bang is developing a multi-pronged approach named \"muktipath\" in the district of gadchiroli to reduce the prevalence of alcohol and tobacco consumption there. he also welcomed supreme court of india\\'s ban on liquor shops on state and national highways.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' women\\'s issues \\'\\'\\'\\nrani bang has worked extensively on women\\'s medical issues. the community based study of gynaecological problems in rural area that she conducted in 1988 is the first study in the world focusing on women\\'s health beyond maternity care. rani bang first brought to the notice of the world that rural women had a large hidden burden of gynecological diseases. she subsequently trained the dais in villages to make them village level health workers. with convincing evidence she advocated the need for a comprehensive reproductive health care package for rural women in india. this study initiated the programme of women\\'s reproductive health all over the world specifically in developing countries.\\nshe has written a book – putting woman first, which throws light on women\\'s issues in rural india. their research showed that nearly 92 percent of women had some kind of gynaecological issues. her research in this field has changed the understanding of this issue worldwide and global policy has changed accordingly.\\nrani bang was one of the principal speakers in tietze symposium in rio de janeiro, brazil in 1990. she served as a consultant to inclen (international clinical epidemiology network) for reproductive health, iwham (international women\\'s health advocates on microbicides), 10th five year plan maharashtra health and nutrition committee member. she was nominated for nobel peace prize in 2003 as a member of 1000 women worldwide for peace prize.\\nrani bang has worked on women\\'s reproductive health issues, sexually transmitted diseases and aids control, adolescent sexual health, tribal health, alcohol and alcoholism. she conducts sessions on sex education called \\'tarunyabhaan\\' for adolescents and teenagers across maharashtra.\\nrani bang has been awarded with national award for women\\'s development through application of science & technology in recognition of her outstanding and pioneering contribution for the past two and a half decades on improving women\\'s health in rural india through an innovative and powerful approach of research with the people and for the people. the award was conferred upon her by the president of india at the national conference on showcasing cutting edge science & technology by women in new delhi.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' tribal health \\'\\'\\'\\nabhay and rani bang have been working with the tribal communities in the forest area of gadchiroli district in maharashtra since 1986. they found malaria to pose the biggest health concern for this population. they sought to make the local adivasis aware about the importance of using insecticide-treated mosquito nets, in addition to regular medical treatment. they also run a mobile medical unit in the forty eight tribal villages in the dhanora block of gadchiroli district and have a network of village volunteers trained in providing primary care in these villages. in july 2017, the government of maharashtra formed a task force to control the spread of malaria in the district of gadchiroli. abhay bang has been appointed as the head of this task force which comprises the nonprofit search, tata trusts, national institute of research and tribal health (nirth) and the government of maharashtra.\\nabhay bang is chairing a 13-member expert committee set up by union health ministry and the ministry of tribal affairs, tasked with coming out with a nationwide status report on tribal health issues along with suggesting possible policy formulations. while the \"old\" problems of malaria, malnutrition and mortality persist, abhay bang emphasises \"new\" health issues among tribals partly due to outside socio-cultural influences and steady inroads by market forces. tribal women now list alcohol addiction among men as their biggest concern. the same goes with tobacco, with over 60 per cent of adults in gadchiroli consuming it daily. these, alongside addition of salt in their foods and stress, are contributing to increased incidence of hypertension, according to bang. the problems of language barrier and lack of motivation among healthcare staff, besides vacancies and absenteeism when it comes to working in tribal areas, has rendered the formal public healthcare system virtually dysfunctional.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' nirman \\'\\'\\'\\nin 2006, they started an initiative, nirman, for identifying and nurturing young social change-makers in maharashtra. it is an educational process to train the youth to take up crucial issues and problems in the society. nirman provides guidance, expertise and environment to inculcate self learning and encourages youth for social action. nirman includes a series of 3 camps, each separated by 6 months. so a batch of nirman goes through 3 camps in a period of 1 year. a camp generally runs for 7–10 days at search, gadchiroli. nirman is a learning process based on nai talim way of education introduced by mahatma gandhi. it believes in – problem based learning instead of – classroom based learning. nirman initiative is providing a common platform for youth to engage, self-educate and decide on how they can make a difference to the society.\\nstarted in 2006, nirman brings together a group of youth aged between 18–28 years who are looking to give meaning to their lives. amrut, abhay and rani bang\\'s younger son actively manage nirman.\\nabhay thinks that it is important to make present generation of doctors think about social challenges. \"all doctors can earn enough to make a decent living and they must think about the purpose of their lives. change would happen the moment they start contemplating.\" he believes that medical students should regularly be given rural or tribal stints as part of their curriculum so that they are exposed to the real

\\'\\'\\'\\nabhay and rani bang and their team at search has started working on the non-communicable diseases (ncds) as that is emerging as a priority area. a study conducted by search in 86 villages of gadchiroli district has shown that rural people are now falling prey to lifestyle diseases like stroke which emerged as the most frequent cause of death. one in seven (14%) deaths in these villages occurs due to stroke, showing that the places like gadchiroli are now passing through an \\'epidemiological transition\\'. 87.3% stroke deaths occurred at home, indicating that rural people don\\'t approach hospitals for treatment. taking the study ahead, the search team now plans to test village based solutions to minimize deaths caused due to stroke in gadchiroli villages in collaboration with the wellcome trust of uk and the department of biotechnology of the government of india.\\nyogeshwar kalkonde, neurologist and senior research officer at search is the main author of the study. the

presented at the 5th international conference on neurology and epidemiology (18–20 november 2015) in australia.in a study published in economic and political weekly, bang and search team members showed that the rural and tribal district of gadchiroli was spending approximately ₹73.4 crore. annually on consuming tobacco and related products. more than 50% of the population was consuming tobacco. search has been conducting programs to spread awareness regarding the ill effects of tobacco use and providing de-addiction services. the maharashtra state government has formed a 12-member task force under chief minister devendra fadnavis for creating awareness about ill effects of using tobacco products and abhay bang is an advisor in the force. it will concentrate on gadchiroli district for the first three years. a committee has also been constituted under the gadchiroli district collector for implementing the plans devised by the task force. a representative of bang\\'s organization search will be a member of the committee. according to bang, spread of information and awareness for prevention, initiation of village committees and urban ward committees, implementation of laws and regulations, treatment for deaddiction, counselling via ngos and stimulation of an alcohol and tobacco free environment in government offices, schools, colleges, markets etc. will be the methods used by the task force.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' surgical care \\'\\'\\'\\nthe couple, through their organisation search, built the maa danteshwari hospital for the rural and tribal people of

       " '\\'\\'\\' basic \\'\\'\\'\\n\\ngates read the january 1975 issue of popular electronics which demonstrated the altair 8800, and he contacted micro instrumentation and telemetry systems (mits) to inform them that he and others were working on a basic interpreter for the platform. in reality, gates and allen did not have an altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge mits\\'s interest. mits president ed roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the basic interpreter. the demonstration was held at mits\\'s offices in albuquerque, new mexico; it was a success and resulted in a deal with mits to distribute the interpreter as altair basic. mits hired allen, and gates took a leave of absence from harvard to work with him at mits in november 1975. allen named their partnership \"micro-soft\", a combination of \"microcomputer\" and \"software\", and their first office was in albuquerque. the first employee gates and allen hired was their high school collaborator ric weiland. they dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name \"microsoft\" with the secretary of the state of new mexico on november 26, 1976. gates never returned to harvard to complete his studies.\\nmicrosoft\\'s altair basic was popular with computer hobbyists, but gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed. in february 1976, he wrote an open letter to hobbyists in the mits newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of microsoft altair basic had not paid microsoft for it and the altair \"hobby market\" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software. this letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. microsoft became independent of mits in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems. the company moved from albuquerque to bellevue, washington on january 1, 1979.gates said he personally reviewed and often rewrote every line of code that the company produced in its first five years. as the company grew, he transitioned into a manager role, then an executive.donkey.bas, is a computer game written in 1981 and included with early versions of the pc dos operating system distributed with the original ibm pc. it is a driving game in which the player must avoid hitting donkeys. the game was written by gates and neil konzen.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' ibm partnership \\'\\'\\'\\nibm, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached microsoft in july 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the ibm pc, after bill gates\\'s mother, mary maxwell gates, mentioned microsoft to john opel, ibm\\'s ceo. ibm first proposed that microsoft write the basic interpreter. ibm\\'s representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system, and gates referred them to digital research (dri), makers of the widely used cp/m operating system. ibm\\'s discussions with digital research went poorly, however, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. ibm representative jack sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with gates and asked if microsoft could provide an operating system. a few weeks later, gates and allen proposed using 86-dos, an operating system similar to cp/m, that tim paterson of seattle computer products (scp) had made for hardware similar to the pc. microsoft made a deal with scp to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-dos, and later the full owner. microsoft employed paterson to adapt the operating system for the pc and delivered it to ibm as pc dos for a one-time fee of $50,000.the contract itself only earned microsoft a relatively small fee. it was the prestige brought to microsoft by ibm\\'s adoption of their operating system that would be the origin of microsoft\\'s transformation from a small business to the leading software company in the world. gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on the operating system to ibm because he believed that other personal computer makers would clone ibm\\'s pc hardware. they did, making the ibm-compatible pc, running dos, a de facto standard. the sales of ms-dos (the version of dos sold to customers other than ibm) made microsoft a major player in the industry. the press quickly identified microsoft as being very influential on the ibm pc. pc magazine asked if gates was \"the man behind the machine?\".gates oversaw microsoft\\'s company restructuring on june 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in washington state and made gates the president and chairman of the board, with paul allen as vice president and vice chairman. in early 1983, allen left the company after receiving a hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, effectively ending the formal business partnership between gates and allen, which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over microsoft equity. later in the decade, gates repaired his relationship with allen and together the two donated millions to their childhood school lakeside. they remained friends until allen\\'s death in october 2018.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' windows \\'\\'\\'\\nmicrosoft and gates launched their first retail version of microsoft windows on november 20, 1985, in an attempt to fend off competition from apple\\'s macintosh gui, which had bewitched consumers with its simplicity and ease of use. in august of the following year, the company struck a deal with ibm to develop a separate operating system called os/2. although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences. the operating system grew out of dos in an organic fashion over a decade, until with windows 95 the dos text screen was relegated to the closet. windows xp, released one year after gates stepped down as microsoft ceo, reportedly was the first to not be based on dos. windows 8.1 was the last version of the os released before gates left the chair of the firm to john w. thompson on february 5, 2014. as of 2021, the latest release of the os is known as windows 11.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' management style \\'\\'\\'\\n\\ngates had primary responsibility for microsoft\\'s product strategy from the company\\'s founding from 1975 until 2006. he gained a reputation for being distant from others; an industry executive complained in 1981 that \"gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.\" an atari executive recalled that he showed gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. when they met again a month later, gates \"won or tied every game. he had studied the game until he solved it. that is a competitor\".in the early 1980s, while business partner paul allen was undergoing treatments for cancer, gates — according to allen — conspired to reduce allen\\'s share in microsoft  by issuing himself stock options. in his autobiography, allen would later recall that gates was \"scheming to rip me off. it was mercenary opportunism plain and simple\". gates says he remembers the episode differently. allen would also recall that gates was prone to shouting episodes.gates met regularly with microsoft\\'s senior managers and program managers, and the managers described him as being verbally combative. he also berated them for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company\\'s long-term interests at risk. he interrupted presentations with such comments as \"that\\'s the stupidest thing i\\'ve ever heard\" and \"why don\\'t you just give up your options and join the peace corps?\" the target of his outburst would then have to defend the proposal in detail until gates was fully convinced. when subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, \"i\\'ll do it over the weekend.\"  gates has been accused of bullying microsoft employees.during microsoft\\'s early years, gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company\\'s programming language products, but his primary role in most of the company\\'s history was as a manager and executive. he has not officially been on a development team since working on the trs-80 model 100, but he wrote code that shipped with the company\\'s products as late as 1989. jerry pournelle wrote in 1985 when gates announced microsoft excel: \"bill gates likes the program, not because it\\'s going to make him a lot of money (although i\\'m sure it will do that), but because it\\'s a neat hack.\"on june 15, 2006, gates announced that he would transition out of his role at microsoft to dedicate more time to philanthropy. he gradually divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed ray ozzie in charge of management and craig mundie in charge of long-term product strategy. the process took two years to fully transfer his duties to ozzie and mundie, and was completed on june 27, 2008.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' antitrust litigation \\'\\'\\'\\n\\ngates approved of many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over microsoft\\'s business practices. in the 1998 united states v. microsoft case, gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. he argued with examiner david boies over the contextual meaning of words such as \"compete\", \"concerned\", and \"we\". later in the year, when portions of the videotaped deposition were played back in court, the judge was seen laughing and shaking his head. businessweek reported:\\n\\nearly rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying \"i don\\'t recall\" so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. worse, many of the technology chief\\'s denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that gates both sent and received.\\ngates later said that he had simply resisted attempts by boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. \"did i fence with boies? ... i plead guilty ... rudeness to boies in the first degree.\" despite gates\\'s denials, the judge ruled that microsoft had committed monopolization, tying and blocking competition, each in violation of the sherman antitrust act.',\n",
       " 'since leaving day-to-day operations at microsoft, gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.\\naccording to the bloomberg billionaires index, gates was the world\\'s highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by us$15.8 billion to us$78.5 billion. as of january 2014, most of gates\\'s assets are held in cascade investment llc, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including four seasons hotels and resorts, and corbis corp. on february 4, 2014, gates stepped down as chairman of microsoft to become \"technology advisor\" at the firm, alongside ceo satya nadella.gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the march 27, 2014, issue of rolling stone magazine. in the interview, gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of america. in response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, gates stated: \"there\\'ll be some really bad things that\\'ll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn\\'t expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism.\" gates also identified innovation as the \"real driver of progress\" and pronounced that \"america\\'s way better today than it\\'s ever been.\"gates has expressed concern about the potential harms of superintelligence; in a reddit \"ask me anything\", he stated that:\\n\\nfirst the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. that should be positive if we manage it well. a few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. i agree with elon musk and some others on this and don\\'t understand why some people are not concerned.\\nin an interview that was held at the ted conference in march 2015, with baidu\\'s ceo, robin li, gates said he would \"highly recommend\" nick bostrom\\'s recent work, superintelligence: paths, dangers, strategies. during the conference, gates warned that the world was not prepared for the next pandemic, a situation that would come to pass in late 2019 when the covid-19 pandemic began. in march 2018, gates met at his home in seattle with mohammed bin salman, the reformist crown prince and de facto ruler of saudi arabia to discuss investment opportunities for saudi vision 2030. in june 2019, gates admitted that losing the mobile operating system race to android was his biggest mistake. he stated that it was within their skill set of being the dominant player, but partially blames the antitrust litigation during the time. that same year, gates became an advisory board member of the bloomberg new economy forum.on march 13, 2020, microsoft announced gates would be leaving his board positions at berkshire hathaway and microsoft to dedicate his efforts in philanthropic endeavors such as climate change, global health and development, and education.during the covid-19 pandemic, gates has widely been looked at by media outlets as an expert on the issue, despite him not being a public official or having any prior medical training. his foundation did, however, establish the covid-19 therapeutics accelerator in 2020 to hasten the development and evaluation of new and repurposed drugs and biologics to treat patients for covid-19, and, as of february 2021, gates expressed that he and anthony fauci frequently talk and collaborate on matters including vaccines and

       " 'gates considers climate change and global access to energy to be critical, interrelated issues. he has urged governments and the private sector to invest in research and development to make clean, reliable energy cheaper. gates envisions that a breakthrough innovation in sustainable energy technology could drive down both greenhouse gas emissions and poverty, and bring economic benefits by stabilizing energy prices. in 2011, he said: \"if you gave me the choice between picking the next 10 presidents or ensuring that energy is environmentally friendly and a quarter as costly, i\\'d pick the energy thing.\"in 2015, he wrote about the challenge of transitioning the world\\'s energy system from one based primarily on fossil fuels to one based on sustainable energy sources. global energy transitions have historically taken decades. he wrote, \"i believe we can make this transition faster, both because the pace of innovation is accelerating, and because we have never had such an urgent reason to move from one source of energy to another.\" this rapid transition, according to gates, would depend on increased government funding for basic research and financially risky private-sector investment, to enable innovation in diverse areas such as nuclear energy, grid energy storage to facilitate greater use of solar and wind energy, and solar fuels.\\n\\ngates spearheaded two initiatives that he announced at the 2015 united nations climate change conference in paris. one was mission innovation, in which 20 national governments pledged to double their spending on research and development for carbon-free energy in over five years\\' time. another initiative was breakthrough energy, a group of investors who agreed to fund high-risk startups in clean energy technologies. gates, who had already invested $1 billion of his own money in innovative energy startups, committed a further $1 billion to breakthrough energy. in december 2020, he called for the u.s. federal government to create institutes for clean energy research, analogous to the national institutes of health. gates has also urged rich nations to shift to 100% synthetic beef industries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from food production.gates has been criticised for holding a large stake in signature aviation, a company that services emissions-intensive private jets. in 2019, he began to divest from fossil fuels. he does not expect divestment itself to have much practical impact, but says that if his efforts to provide alternatives were to fail, he would not want to personally benefit from an increase in fossil fuel stock prices. after he published his book how to avoid a climate disaster, parts of the climate activist community criticized gate\\'s approach as technological solutionism.in june 2021, gates\\'s company terrapower and warren buffett\\'s pacificorp announced the first sodium nuclear reactor in wyoming. wyoming governor mike gordon hailed the project as a step toward carbon-negative nuclear power. wyoming senator john barrasso also said that it could boost the state\\'s once-active uranium mining industry.',\n",
       " '\\'\\'\\' regulation of the software industry \\'\\'\\'\\n\\nin 1998, gates rejected the need for regulation of the software industry in testimony before the united states senate. during the federal trade commission\\'s (ftc) investigation of microsoft in the 1990s, gates was reportedly upset at commissioner dennis yao for \"float[ing] a line of hypothetical questions suggesting possible curbs on microsoft\\'s growing monopoly power\". according to one source:gates was vexed. \"he started by calling yao\\'s ideas socialistic,\" recalls a source familiar with the july 15 meeting, \"and as he got angrier and angrier and louder and louder, he got into calling them communistic.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' donald trump facebook ban \\'\\'\\'\\non february 18, 2021, after facebook and twitter had banned donald trump from their platforms as a result of the 2020 united states presidential election which led to the 2021 united states capitol attack, gates said a permanent ban of trump \"would be a shame\" and would be an \"extreme measure\". he warned that it would cause \"polarization\" if users with different political views divide up among various social networks, and said: \"i don\\'t think banning somebody who actually did get a fair number of votes (in the presidential election) – well less than a majority – but i don\\'t think having him off forever would be that good.\"\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' patents for covid-19 vaccines \\'\\'\\'\\n\\nin april 2021, during the covid-19 pandemic, gates was criticized for suggesting that pharmaceutical companies should hold onto patents for covid-19 vaccines. the criticism came due to the possibility of this preventing poorer nations from obtaining adequate vaccines. tara van ho of the university of essex stated, \"gates speaks as if all the lives being lost in india are inevitable but eventually the west will help when in reality the us & uk are holding their feet on the neck of developing states by refusing to break [intellectual property rights] protections. it\\'s disgusting.\"bill gates is opposed to the trips waiver. bloomberg news reported him as saying he argued that oxford university should not give away the rights to its covid-19 information, as it had announced, but instead sell it to a single industry partner, as it did. his views on the value of legal monopolies in medicine have been linked to his views on legal monopolies in software.',\n",
       " '\\'\\'\\' bill and melinda gates foundation \\'\\'\\'\\n\\ngates studied the work of andrew carnegie and john d. rockefeller, and donated some of his microsoft stock in 1994 to create the \"william h. gates foundation\". in 2000, gates and his wife combined three family foundations and gates donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the charitable bill & melinda gates foundation, which was identified by the funds for ngos company in 2013, as the world\\'s wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion. the foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the wellcome trust. gates, through his foundation, also donated $20 million to carnegie mellon university for a new building to be named gates center for computer science which opened in 2009.gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of david rockefeller as a major influence. gates and his father met with rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the rockefeller family\\'s philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations. as of 2007, bill and melinda gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in america, having given over $28 billion to charity; the couple plan to eventually donate 95% of their wealth to charity.the foundation is organized into five program areas: global development division, global health division, united states division, and global policy & advocacy division. among others, it supports a wide range of public health projects, granting aid to fight transmissible diseases such aids, tuberculosis and malaria, as well as widespread vaccine programs to eradicate polio. it grants funds to learning institutes and libraries and supports scholarships at universities. the foundation established a water, sanitation and hygiene program to provide sustainable sanitation services in poor countries. its agriculture division supports the international rice research institute in developing golden rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat vitamin a deficiency. the goal of the foundation is to provide 120 million women and girls, in the poorest countries, with high-quality contraceptive information and services, with the longer-term goal of universal access to voluntary family planning. in 2007, the los angeles times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, pollution and pharmaceutical firms that do not sell to developing countries. although the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility, it was subsequently canceled and upheld its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.\\n\\ngates delivered his thoughts in a fireside chat moderated by journalist and news anchor shereen bhan virtually at the singapore fintech festival on december 8, 2020, on the topic, \"building infrastructure for resilience: what the covid-19 response can teach us about how to scale financial inclusion\".\\ngovernments are there to think ahead to bad things that might happen. in the case of (the covid-19) pandemic, not enough was done. we can\\'t forget that another pandemic will come and we\\'ll need to invest in being ready in that, ... while not forgetting that we were not prepared and we\\'re going to have to invest – just like having a fire department – some money in an intelligent way and actually simulate what might happen and make sure that we\\'re ready for it.\\ngates favours the normalization of covid-19 masks. in a november 2020 interview, he said: \"what are these, like, nudists? i mean, you know, we ask you to wear pants, and no american says, or very few americans say, that that\\'s, like, some terrible thing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' personal donations \\'\\'\\'\\nmelinda gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the salwen family, who sold their home and gave away half of its value, as detailed in their book, the power of half. gates and his wife invited joan salwen to seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on december 9, 2010, bill and melinda gates and investor warren buffett each signed a commitment they called the \"giving pledge\", which is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth, over the course of time, to charity.gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. in 1999, gates donated $20 million to the massachusetts institute of technology for the construction of a computer laboratory named the \"william h. gates building\" that was designed by architect frank gehry. while microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from gates.the maxwell dworkin laboratory of the harvard john a. paulson school of engineering and applied sciences is named after the mothers of both gates and microsoft president steven a. ballmer, both of whom were students (ballmer was a member of the school\\'s graduating class of 1977, while gates left his studies for microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory\\'s construction. gates also donated $6 million to the construction of the gates computer science building, completed in january 1996, on the campus of stanford university. the building contains the computer science department and the computer systems laboratory (csl) of stanford\\'s engineering department.since 2005, gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems. for example, they announced the \"reinvent the toilet challenge\", which has received considerable media interest. to raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, gates drank water that was \"produced from human feces\" in 2014 – it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the omni processor. in early 2015, he also appeared with jimmy fallon on the tonight show and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.in november 2017, gates said he would give $50 million to the dementia discovery fund, a venture capital fund that seeks treatment for alzheimer\\'s disease. he also pledged an additional $50 million to start-up ventures working in alzheimer\\'s research. bill and melinda gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10 million each as their inheritance. with only $30 million kept in the family, they are expected to give away about 99.96% of their wealth. on august 25, 2018, gates distributed $600,000 through his foundation via unicef which is helping flood affected victims in kerala, india.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' charity sports events \\'\\'\\'\\non april 29, 2017, gates partnered with swiss tennis legend roger federer in playing in the match for africa 4, a noncompetitive tennis match at a sold-out key arena in seattle. the event was in support of the roger federer foundation\\'s charity efforts in africa. federer and gates played against john isner, the top-ranked american player for much of this decade, and mike mccready, the lead guitarist for pearl jam. the pair won the match 6 games to 4. overall, they raised $2 million for children in africa. the following year, gates and federer returned to play in the match for africa 5 on march 5, 2018, at san jose\\'s sap center. their opponents were jack sock, one of the top american players and a grand slam winner in doubles, and savannah guthrie, a co-anchor for nbc\\'s today show. gates and federer recorded their second match victory together by a score of 6–3 and the event raised over $2.5 million.',\n",

       " 'gates is an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from the great gatsby. he also enjoys bridge, tennis and golf. his days are planned for him on a minute-by-minute basis, similarly to the u.s. president\\'s schedule. despite his wealth and extensive business travel, gates flew coach (economy class) in commercial aircraft until 1997, when he bought a private jet.gates purchased the codex leicester, a collection of scientific writings by leonardo da vinci, for us$30.8 million at an auction in 1994. in 1998, he reportedly paid $30 million for the original 1885 maritime painting lost on the grand banks, at the time a record price for an american painting.in 2016, he revealed that he was color-blind.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' marriage and divorce \\'\\'\\'\\n\\ngates married melinda french on the hawaiian island of lanai on january 1, 1994. they met in 1987 after melinda began working at microsoft. at the time of their marriage, gates was given permission by melinda to spend limited time with his ex-girlfriend, businesswoman ann winblad. bill and melinda have three children: jennifer, rory and phoebe. the family\\'s residence is an earth-sheltered mansion in the side of a hill overlooking lake washington in medina, washington. in 2009, property taxes on the mansion were reported to be us$1.063 million, on a total assessed value of us$147.5 million. the 66,000-square-foot (6,100 m2) estate has a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500-square-foot (230 m2) gym and a 1,000-square-foot (93 m2) dining room. on may 3, 2021, the gateses announced they had decided to divorce after 27 years of marriage and 34 years as a couple. they said they would keep working together on charitable efforts. the wall street journal reported that melinda had been meeting with divorce attorneys since 2019, citing interviews that suggested bill\\'s ties with jeffrey epstein was at least one of her concerns. the divorce was finalized on august 2, 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' relationship with jeffrey epstein \\'\\'\\'\\na new york times article reported that gates\\'s relationship with convicted sex offender jeffrey epstein started in 2011, just a few years after epstein\\'s conviction, and continued for some years, including a visit to epstein\\'s house with melinda in the fall of 2013, despite her declared discomfort. gates said in 2011 about epstein: \"his lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me\".the depth of the friendship between gates and epstein is unclear. gates generally commented about his relationship with epstein that \"i met him. i didn\\'t have any business relationship or friendship with him\". however, gates visited epstein \"many times, despite [epstein\\'s] past\".it was reported that epstein and gates \"discussed the gates foundation and philanthropy\". however, in an interview in 2019 gates completely denied any connection between epstein and the gates foundation or his philanthropy generally.  in august 2021, gates said the reason he had meetings with epstein was because gates hoped epstein could provide money for philanthropic work, though nothing came of the idea. gates added, \"it was a huge mistake to spend time with him, to give him the credibility of being there.\"it has also been reported that epstein and gates met with nobel committee chair thorbjørn jagland at his residence in strasbourg, france in march 2013 to discuss the nobel prize. also in attendance were representatives of the international peace institute which has received millions in grants from the gates foundation, including a $2.5 million \"community engagement\" grant in october 2013.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' public image \\'\\'\\'\\n\\ngates\\'s public image has changed over the years. at first he was perceived as a brilliant but ruthless \"robber baron\", a \"nerd-turned-tycoon\". starting in 2000 with the foundation of the bill and melinda gates foundation, and particularly after he stepped down as head of microsoft, he turned his attention to philanthropy, spending more than $50 billion on causes like health, poverty, and education. his image morphed from \"tyrannical technocrat to saintly savior\" to a \"huggable billionaire techno-philanthropist\", celebrated on magazine covers and sought after for his opinions on major issues like global health and climate change. still another shift in public opinion came in 2021 with the announcement that he and melinda were divorcing. coverage of that proceeding brought out information about romantic pursuits of women who worked for him, a long-term extra-marital affair, and a friendship with convicted child sex trafficker jeffrey epstein. this information and his response to the covid-19 pandemic resulted in some deterioration of his public image, going from \"a lovable nerd who was out to save the world.\" to \"a tech supervillain who wants to protect profits over public health.\"\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' religion \\'\\'\\'\\nin an interview with rolling stone, gates said in regard to his faith: \"the moral systems of religion, i think, are super important. we\\'ve raised our kids in a religious way; they\\'ve gone to the catholic church that melinda goes to and i participate in. i\\'ve been very lucky, and therefore i owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. and that\\'s kind of a religious belief. i mean, it\\'s at least a moral belief.\" in the same 2014 interview he also said: \"i agree with people like richard dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. but the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there\\'s no scientific explanation of how it came about. to say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. i think it makes sense to believe in god, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, i don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' wealth tallies \\'\\'\\'\\nin 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed us$101 billion. since 2000, the nominal value of his microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in microsoft\\'s stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multi-billion dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. in may 2006, gates remarked that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought. in march 2010, gates was the second wealthiest person after  carlos slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the bloomberg billionaires list. slim retook the position again in june 2014 (but then lost the top position back to gates). between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from us$40 billion to more than us$82 billion. in october 2017, gates was surpassed by amazon founder jeff bezos as the richest person in the world. on november 15, 2019, he once again became the richest person in the world after a 48% increase in microsoft shares, surpassing bezos. gates told the bbc, \"i\\'ve paid more tax than any individual ever, and gladly so ... i\\'ve paid over $6 billion in taxes.\" he is a proponent of higher taxes, particularly for the rich.by 2017, gates had held the top spot on the list of the world\\'s billionaires for 18 out of the previous 23 years. gates has several investments outside microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of us$616,667 and us$350,000 bonus totalling us$966,667. in 1989, he founded corbis, a digital imaging company. in 2004, he became a director of berkshire hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend warren buffett.in 1987, gates was listed as a billionaire in forbes magazine\\'s 400 richest people in america issue, worth $1.25 billion at the time, and was the world\\'s youngest self-made billionaire. since 1987, gates has been included in the forbes the world\\'s billionaires list and was the wealthiest person from 1995 to 1996, 1998 to 2007, 2009, and held the spot until 2018 before being overtaken by jeff bezos. gates was number one on the forbes 400 list from 1993 through to 2007, 2009, and 2014 through

       " 'blackman called for the adoption of plain packaging legislation for cigarettes, and supported cameron\\'s plan calling for energy companies to provide simplified energy bills to their customers. on 1 july 2015, blackman was elected chair of the all party political group on smoking and health, after serving as its secretary for several years.in 2012, when the conservative party launched a consultation into legalising same-sex marriages, blackman suggested that david cameron should resurrect section 28, stating that he believed that \"section 28 was the right rules to have in school so that we should not in any way shape or form promote same-sex relationships\" and said he would be \"very opposed\" to seeing teachers being forced to say same-sex relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships. in december 2012, david cameron announced his approval for same-sex marriage. in response, on 7 december 2012, blackman told the bbc news channel that cameron\\'s backing of religious same-sex marriages was wrong \"on principle\" and that marriage had to be \"between one man and one woman\". according to the harrow times, he was accused of hypocrisy by a former fellow brent council colleague who claimed she had an 11-year affair with him whilst he was married. on 5 february 2013, bob blackman voted against the bill in the house of commons second reading vote on marriage equality in britain. \\nin march 2019, blackman was one of 21 mps who voted against lgbt-inclusive sex and relationship education in english schools.in 2016, he was drawn second in the annual parliamentary ballot for a private member\\'s bill and put together a homelessness reduction bill in partnership with national homelessness charity, crisis. it was the first private member\\'s bill to be supported by a select committee. after receiving government support at second reading, it passed through all stages in parliament unopposed in both houses and received royal assent on 27 april 2017.following an interim report on the connections between colonialism and properties now in the care of the national trust, including links with historic slavery, blackman was among the signatories of a letter to the telegraph from the \"common sense group\" of conservative parliamentarians. the letter accused the national trust of being \"coloured by cultural marxist dogma, colloquially known as the \\'woke agenda\\'\".',\n",
       " \"blackman married nicola jennings in 1988. he employs his wife as a part-time office manager on a salary up to £39,999.in 2000, it was made public that blackman had had an 11 year affair (which began in the late 80s) with a colleague he met whilst working as a councillor at the brent east conservative association. his then mistress, carol shaw, gave an affidavit about their affair to a solicitor in 2000 - after being persuaded to do so by one of blackman's rivals who hoped to see him ousted as a group leader. the affidavit was copied and distributed amongst his fellow conservative councillors by the rival.\",\n",

monasteries were \"full of disorder\"; many religious were \"lazy, ignorant, and debauched\". borromeo made numerous pastoral visits and restored dignity to divine service. he urged churches to be designed in conformity with the decrees of the council of trent, which stated that sacred art and architecture lacking adequate scriptural foundation was in effect prohibited, as was any inclusion of classical pagan elements in religious art. he divided the nave of the church into two compartments to separate the sexes at worship.he extended his reforms to the collegiate churches, monasteries and even to the confraternities of penitents, particularly that of st. john the baptist. this group was to attend to prisoners and those condemned to death, to give them help and support.\\n\\nborromeo believed that abuses in the church arose from ignorant clergy. among his most important actions, he established seminaries, colleges, and communities for the education of candidates for holy orders. his emphasis on catholic learning greatly increased the preparation of men for the priesthood and benefited their congregations. in addition, he founded the fraternity of oblates of st. ambrose, a society of secular men who did not take orders, but devoted themselves to the church and followed a discipline of monastic prayers and study.  they provided assistance to parishes where ordered by the church. the new archbishop\\'s efforts for catechesis and the instruction of youth included the initiation of the first \"sunday school\" classes and the work of the confraternity for christian doctrine.\\nborromeo diocesan reforms faced opposition from several religious orders, particularly that of the humiliati (brothers of humility), a penitential order which, although reduced to about 170 members, owned some ninety monasteries. some members of that society formed a conspiracy against his life, and a shot was fired at him in the archepiscopal chapel.  his survival was considered miraculous.in 1576 there was famine at milan due to crop failures, and later an outbreak of the plague. the city\\'s trade fell off, and along with it the people\\'s source of income. the governor and many members of the nobility fled the city, but the bishop remained, to organize the care of those affected and to minister to the dying. he called together the superiors of all the religious communities in the diocese and won their cooperation. borromeo tried to feed 60,000 to 70,000 people daily. he used up his own funds and went into debt to provide food for the hungry. finally, he wrote to the governor and successfully persuaded him to return.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' influence on english affairs \\'\\'\\'\\nborromeo had also been involved in english affairs when he assisted pius iv. many english catholics had fled to italy at this time because of the persecutions under queen elizabeth i. he gave pastoral attention to english catholics who fled to italy to escape the new laws against the catholic faith. edmund campion, a jesuit, along with ralph sherwin visited him at milan in 1580 on their way to england.  they stayed with him for eight days, talking with him every night after dinner. a welshman, griffith roberts, served as his canon theologian, and an englishman, thomas goldwell, as vicar-general. the archbishop carried on his person a small picture of john fisher, who, with thomas more, had been executed during the reign of henry viii, and for whom he held a great veneration.  during the nineteenth-century catholic restoration in england, cardinal wiseman was to institute an order of oblates of st charles, led by henry edward manning, as a congregation of secular priests directly supporting the archbishop of westminster.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' persecution of religious dissidents \\'\\'\\'\\n\\nthough the diet of ilanz of 1524 and 1526 had proclaimed freedom of worship in the republic of the three leagues, borromeo repressed protestantism in the swiss valleys. the catholic encyclopedia relates: \"in november [1583] he began a visitation as apostolic visitor of all the cantons of switzerland and the grisons, leaving the affairs of his diocese in the hands of monsignor owen lewis, his vicar-general. he began in the mesoleina valley; here not only was their heresy to be fought, but also witchcraft and sorcery, and at roveredo it was discovered that \"the provost or rector, was the foremost in sorceries.\" during his pastoral visit to the region, 150 people were arrested for practicing witchcraft. eleven women and the provost were condemned by the civil authorities to be burned alive.reacting to the pressure of the protestant reformation, borromeo encouraged ludwig pfyffer in his development of the golden league, but did not live to see its formation in 1586.  based in lucerne, the organization (also called the borromean league) linked activities of several swiss catholic cantons of switzerland, which became the centre of catholic counter-reformation efforts.  this organization was determined to expel heretics and burn some people at the stake. it created severe strains in the civil administration of the confederation, and caused the break-up of appenzell canton along religious lines.',\n",
       " 'charged with implementing the reforms dictated by the council of trent, borromeo\\'s uncompromising stance brought him into conflict with secular leaders, priests, and even the pope. he met with much opposition to his reforms. the governor of the province and many of the senators addressed complaints to the courts of rome and madrid.in 1584, during his annual retreat at monte varallo, he fell ill with \"intermittent fever and ague\", and on returning to milan grew rapidly worse. after receiving the last rites, he quietly died on 3 november at the age of 46.',\n",
       " \"following his death, popular devotion to borromeo arose quickly and continued to grow. the milanese celebrated his anniversary as though he were already a saint, and supporters in a number of cities collected documentation to support his canonization.  in 1602 clement viii beatified borromeo. in 1604 his case was sent to the congregation of rites. on 1 november 1610, pope paul v canonized borromeo. three years later, the church added his feast to the general roman calendar for celebration on 4 november. along with guarinus of palestrina and perhaps anselm of lucca, he is one of only two or three cardinal-nephews to have been canonized.\\ncharles borromeo is the patron saint of bishops, catechists and seminarians.\\n\\n\\n''' iconography '''\\nborromeo's emblem is the latin word humilitas (humility), which is a portion of the borromeo shield. he is usually represented in art in his robes, barefoot, carrying the cross as archbishop, a rope around his neck, one hand raised in blessing, thus recalling his work during the plague.\",\n",
       " \"borromeo' biography was originally written by three of his contemporaries: agostino valerio (afterwards cardinal and bishop of verona) and carlo bascape (general of the barnabites, afterwards bishop of novara), who wrote their contributions in latin, and pietro giussanno (a priest), who wrote his in italian. giussanno's account was the most detailed of the three.\",\n",
       " 'borromeo\\'s correspondence shows his influential position in europe during his lifetime. the popes under whom he served sought his advice. the catholic sovereigns of europe – henry iii of france, philip ii of spain, mary, queen of scots – and others showed how they valued his influence. cardinal valerio of verona said of him that borromeo was \"to the well-born a pattern of virtue, to his brother cardinals an example of true nobility.\" cardinal baronius styled him \"a second ambrose, whose early death, lamented by all good men, inflicted great loss on the church.\"\\nlate in the sixteenth or at the beginning of the seventeenth century, catholics in england  circulated among themselves a \"life of st. charles\".\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' monuments \\'\\'\\'\\ncontrary to borromeo\\'s

and hillary and tenzing. hillary, therefore, made a concerted effort to forge a working friendship with tenzing. hillary wrote, \"tenzing had substantially greater personal ambition than any sherpa i had met.\"\\n\\nthe hunt expedition totalled over 400 people, including 362 porters, 20 sherpa guides, and 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) of baggage. lowe supervised the preparation of the lhotse face, a huge and steep ice face, for climbing. hillary forged a route through the treacherous khumbu icefall.cameraman tom stobart was hillary\\'s room-mate in kathmandu. he described hillary as:\\na skeleton as tall as i was ... a hatchet-thin face, and seemed tied together with steel ... i had just got a rubber torch to pieces and couldn\\'t get it together again. this human machine took charge. \\'let\\'s give it a go\\' he said, using an expression we came to know so well in the following months. it may have meant that he would try to fix it, but did not. actually it meant he would fix it, a subtle but important difference so far as ed and his fellow countryman george lowe, were concerned.\\nthe expedition set up base camp in march 1953 and, working slowly, set up its final camp at the south col at 25,900 feet (7,890 m). on 26 may, bourdillon and evans attempted the climb but turned back when evans\\'s oxygen system failed. the pair had reached the south summit, coming within 300 vertical feet (91 m) of the summit. hunt then directed hillary and tenzing to attempt the summit.snow and wind delayed them at the south col for two days. they set out on 28 may with the support of lowe, alfred gregory, and ang nyima. the two pitched a tent at 27,900 feet (8,500 m) on 28 may, while their support group returned down the mountain. on the following morning hillary discovered that his boots had frozen solid outside the tent. he spent two hours warming them over a stove before he and tenzing, wearing 30-pound (14 kg) packs, attempted the final ascent. the final obstacle was the 40-foot (12 m) rock face now called \"hillary step\"; hillary later wrote:\\n\\ni noticed a crack between the rock and the snow sticking to the east face. i crawled inside and wriggled and jammed my way to the top ... tenzing slowly joined me and we moved on. i chopped steps over bump after bump, wondering a little desperately where the top could be. then i saw the ridge ahead dropped away to the north and above me on the right was a rounded snow dome. a few more whacks with my ice-axe and tenzing and i stood on top of everest.\\n\\ntenzing in his 1955 autobiography wrote that hillary took the first step onto the summit and he followed. they reached everest\\'s 29,028 ft (8,848 m) summit – the highest point on earth – at 11:30 am.they spent about 15 minutes at the summit. hillary took a photo of tenzing posing with his ice-axe, but there is no photo of hillary; tenzing\\'s autobiography says that hillary simply declined to have his picture taken. they also took photos looking down the mountain.\\n\\ntenzing left chocolates at the summit as an offering, and hillary left a cross given to him by john hunt. their descent was complicated by drifting snow which had covered their tracks. the first person they met was lowe; hillary said, \"well, george, we knocked the bastard off.\"they returned to kathmandu a few days later and learned that hillary had already been appointed a knight commander of the order of the british empire and hunt a knight bachelor. news reached britain on the day of queen elizabeth ii\\'s coronation, and the press called it a coronation gift. \\nthe 37 members of the party later received the queen elizabeth ii coronation medal with mount everest expedition engraved along the rim.\\nin addition to the knighting of hillary and hunt, tenzing – ineligible for knighthood as a nepalese citizen – received the george medal. tenzing also received the star of nepal from king tribhuvan.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' after everest \\'\\'\\'\\n\\nhillary climbed ten other peaks in the himalayas on further visits in 1956, 1960–1961, and 1963–1965. he also reached the south pole as part of the commonwealth trans-antarctic expedition, for which he led the new zealand section, on 4 january 1958. his party was the first to reach the pole overland since amundsen in 1911 and scott in 1912, and the first ever to do so using motor vehicles.in 1960, hillary organised the 1960–61 silver hut expedition, with griffith pugh; and pugh showed that mount everest could be climbed without oxygen, with a long period of acclimatisation by living at 20,000 feet (6,100 m) for six months. \\nan assault on makalu, the world\\'s fifth-highest mountain, was unsuccessful. hillary was with the expedition for five months, although it lasted for ten.the expedition also searched for the fabled abominable snowman. no evidence of yetis was found, instead footprints and tracks were proven to be from other causes. during the expedition, hillary travelled to remote temples which contained \"yeti scalps\"; however after bringing back three relics, two were shown to be from bears and one from a goat antelope. hillary said after the expedition: \"the yeti is not a strange, superhuman creature as has been imagined. we have found rational explanations for most yeti phenomena\".\\n\\nin 1962, he was a guest on the television game show what\\'s my line?; he stumped the panel, comprising dorothy kilgallen, arlene francis, bennett cerf, and merv griffin.\\nin 1977, he led a jetboat expedition, titled \"ocean to sky\", from the mouth of the ganges river to its source. from 1977 to 1979 he commentated aboard antarctic sightseeing flights operated by air new zealand, and was scheduled to act as the guide for the fatal flight 901, but had to cancel owing to other commitments.\\nin 1985, he accompanied neil armstrong in a small twin-engined ski plane over the arctic ocean and landed at the north pole. hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of everest. this accomplishment inspired generations of explorers to compete over what later was defined as three poles challenge.\\nin january 2007, hillary travelled to antarctica as part of a delegation commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of scott base.',\n",
       " 'on 6 june 1953, hillary was appointed knight commander of the order of the british empire, and he received the queen elizabeth ii coronation medal the same year. on 6 february 1987, he was the fourth appointee to the order of new zealand. he was also awarded the polar medal in 1958 for his part in the commonwealth trans-antarctic expedition, the class of commander of the order of sports merit of france in about 1960, the order of gorkha dakshina bahu, 1st class of the kingdom of nepal in 1953 and the coronation medal in 1975. on 22 april 1995, hillary was appointed knight companion of the most noble order of the garter. on 17 june 2004, hillary was awarded the commander\\'s cross of the order of merit of the republic of poland. the government of india conferred on him its second highest civilian award, the padma vibhushan, posthumously, in 2008.to mark the 50th anniversary of the first successful ascent of everest, the nepalese government conferred honorary citizenship upon hillary at a special golden jubilee celebration in kathmandu, nepal. he was the first foreign national to receive that honour.since 1992, new zealand\\'s $5 note has featured hillary\\'s portrait, making him the only living person not a current head of state ever to appear on a new zealand banknote. in giving his permission, hillary insisted that aoraki / mount cook rather than mount everest be used as the backdrop.\\n\\nannual reader\\'s digest polls from 2005 to 2007 named hillary as \"new zealand\\'s most trusted individual\".hillary\\'s favoured new zealand charity was the sir edmund hillary outdoor pursuits centre, of which he was patron for 35 years. he was particularly keen on how this organisation introduced young new zealanders to the outdoors in a very similar way to his first experience of a school trip to mt ruapehu at the age of 16. a 2.3-metre (7.5 ft) bronze statue of hillary was erected outside the hermitage hotel at mount cook village; it was unveiled by hillary himself in 2003. various streets, institutions and organisations around new zealand and abroad are named after him – for example, the sir edmund hillary collegiate in otara, which was established by hillary in 2001.two antarctic features are named after hillary. the hillary coast is a section of coastline south of ross island and north of the shackleton coast. the hillary canyon, an undersea feature in the ross sea, appears on the general bathymetric chart of the oceans, published by the international hydrographic organization.',\n",

       " '\\'\\'\\' early career \\'\\'\\'\\nwhile gambhir was out of the test team, he played a number of one day internationals for india between 2005 and 2007. however, he was not selected for the 2007 world cup as the selectors opted for a top-order of sourav ganguly, virender sehwag, and sachin tendulkar. it affected him badly and gambhir later said that \"when i got dropped for the world cup, there were times i didn\\'t want to play anymore. i didn\\'t want to practise. i couldn\\'t motivate myself.\" with no other career options, gambhir stuck with cricket. after india\\'s first-round exit from the tournament, gambhir was selected for the one day international on india\\'s 2007 tour of bangladesh. believing the series could be his last chance, gambhir scored his second century on that tour and was subsequently selected for the one day international on india\\'s tour to ireland in 2007. he scored an unbeaten 80 against ireland in the first game of that tour and was awarded the man of the match award for that effort. in the post-match interview, he indicated that performing more consistently was a top priority for his career as he had done so in the past.gambhir was selected in india\\'s squad for the 2007 icc world twenty20, which india went on to win in south africa, beating pakistan in the final. gambhir performed well in the shortest form of the game, ending the tournament as india\\'s top run scorer, with 227 at an average of 37.83, including three half-centuries which included a crucial 75 runs off 54 balls against pakistan in the final. he was named in the \\'team of the tournament\\' by cricinfo for the 2007 t20i world cup.for his performances in 2007, he was named in the world t20i xi by cricinfo.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' golden form \\'\\'\\'\\n\\nin 2008, gambhir was forced to miss the test series in australia due to a shoulder injury. in the 2007–08 cb series, he scored an unbeaten 102 at the gabba against sri lanka in a match washed out due to rain. three weeks later at sydney, he scored a career-best 113 off 119 balls against australia, in a high scoring match which india lost by 18 runs. he finished the cb series as the leading run-scorer with 440 runs.\\nin 2008 gambhir finally solidified his place in the indian test team with a string of high scores. opening the batting with delhi teammate virender sehwag, he scored 858 runs at over 61 in seven matches as of december including a double century against australia in the border-gavaskar trophy. however, in the same match, he was involved in controversy when he elbowed bowler shane watson while taking a run. gambhir asserted it was accidental, but was banned for one test. gambhir scored 463 runs in the series, which despite missing the last match was more than any other player in the series.he was the leading run-scorer in the test series against england in december 2008 and against new zealand in early 2009, meaning that he had achieved this feat in three consecutive series.\\nfor his performances in 2008, he was named in the world test xi and odi xi by cricinfo.gambhir played his first major test series outside the sub-continent, having toured new zealand in 2009. in the second test match, he scored a match-saving 137 in the second innings. he stood more than five sessions in the middle and faced over 430 balls. this innings led virender sehwag, gambhir\\'s opening partner, close friend, and captain for the match, to call him \\'the second wall\\' in reference to rahul dravid. he then scored 167 in the second innings of the third test to give india an unassailable lead, but rain helped the new zealand batsmen to hang on for a draw. gambhir, with 445 runs in six innings at an average of 89, helped india win 1–0 to script a series win in that country after 41 years.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' through ranks \\'\\'\\'\\nhe was named as the icc test player of the year for 2009, and was briefly ranked the no. 1 batsman in the icc rankings in july; at the time india were not playing tests and his points rating did not change, but other batsmen who were ranked higher lost points before regaining them.\\nhe continued his run in the late-2009 test series against sri lanka at home. he scored a century in the second innings of the first test in ahmedabad to force a draw after the visitors had taken a first innings lead of more than 300, and then combined in a double century opening partnership with sehwag on the first day of the second test in kanpur, scoring 167 himself and helping india to score more than 400 runs on the opening day. this set up their score of 642 and an innings victory. following the match, gambhir returned to the top of the icc rankings. gambhir withdrew from the third and final test against sri lanka at the brabourne stadium in mumbai in order to attend his sister\\'s wedding.\\nin the first test against bangladesh in chittagong in january 2009, gambhir hit a rapid 116 from 129 balls. it was his fifth century in as many tests and made him the fourth player to achieve this feat. only don bradman has managed six centuries in as many matches. in the 29th test match against bangladesh at dhaka, he rewrote the history of iva richards by scoring most fifties plus runs in 11 consecutive matches. in this match, he scored 66 runs.\\nfor his performances in 2009, he was named in the world test xi by the icc.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' brief captaincy \\'\\'\\'\\nin 2010, gambhir was appointed captain of the national team in the odi series against new zealand which was hosted by india. he scored an unbeaten 126 in the third match in vadodara to help seal the series, guiding the hosts to victory in the run-chase. he eventually earned the man-of-the-series award for leading india to a 5–0 win. he then returned as captain of the side in india\\'s match against the west indies in december 2011.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' post-captaincy \\'\\'\\'\\nin the final of the cricket world cup 2011, gambhir scored a solid knock of 97 from 122 balls. coming in to bat in the first over after the dismissal of virender sehwag, he anchored the indian inning despite the early dismissal of both the openers. he had a good partnership first with kohli, and then a match-winning partnership of 109 runs with ms dhoni.in 2011, india\\'s batting line-up struggled in tests, particularly away from home. out of sixteen innings in away tests, india passed 300 just twice and both the team\\'s opening batsmen failed to score a century in the format in the whole of 2011. between february 2010 and november 2011, gambhir played in 14 tests. from 25 innings he scored 704 runs at an average of 29.33. in the same period, only two opening batsmen who had played at least 15 innings had a worse average: phillip hughes of australia and imrul kayes of bangladesh. however, while he was struggling in tests, gambhir enjoyed a rich run of form in odis, averaging 56.90 from 23 matches. gambhir opened the batting in all four of india\\'s test defeats against australia in 2011–12. he scored 181 runs at an average of 22.62.for his performances in 2012, he was named in the world odi xi by the icc.\\non 12 february 2012, gambhir scored 92 off 111 balls in an odi match against australia at the adelaide oval, to help india win their first match against the hosts at that venue. it was also india\\'s highest successful run chase in australia. for his effort, gambhir won the man of the match award. on 14 february 2012, against sri lanka, gambhir yet again missed out on an odi hundred when he was dismissed run out for a fine 91 off 106 balls. this knock from gambhir was instrumental in securing a thrilling tie in that match. in august 2012,\\nthe indian selection committee handed  him back vice-captaincy of the t20 squad for the world cup.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' comeback \\'\\'\\'\\nafter a big absence from international cricket, on 8 october 2016, gambhir was recalled for the test-match series against new zealand, after showing good form in domestic cricket.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' retirement \\'\\'\\'\\n\\ngambhir announced his retirement from all forms of cricket on 3 december 2018, ahead of his final match for the delhi cricket team against the andhra cricket team in the ranji trophy on 6 december 2018. gambhir went on to score 112 in his final innings, his 43rd century in first-class cricket. gautam gambhir began his new innings as a parliamentarian as he took oath as the lok sabha mp on 17 june 2019.',\n",
